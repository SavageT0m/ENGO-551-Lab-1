The code that I have written is unfortunately incomplete.
What has been acheived it is just a webpage that allows the user to create their own profile and in the meantime the code makes sure that this user is not a dublicate of an existing one.
After creating the profile the user will be taken to the website where they can search for books that they would like to leave reviews on.
Searching has been implemented although not to a satisfactory level.
The user is able to provide their input in the search bar however the book that they will be searching for will not show up.
This is due to the BOOKS.CVS file and the google api not being implemented in the code.
However what is implemented is that the code is able to register the search that the user provided and keep track of it when the user comes back.
This is something that was going to be implemented for the reviews that the user would leave, however this was not done and such thing was only implemented in the search option.

To be noted:----------
The code provided did not follow the steps provided by the professor. 
After the talk that was had with the TA and the issues that rose were taken care off, the code was not working as needed afterwards. 
I chatted with other students in the class and the best action was to build the webpage from the ground up.

Great inspiration was taken from the following resources:
